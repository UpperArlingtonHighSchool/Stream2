Program needs to be run as a MAVEN Project in order to access JFreeCharts
Each line represents one sample. The order of the data file reads as follows:
location year flowrate turbidity TempinC TDS Conductivity Salinity Hardness TotalChlorine FreeChlorine Alkalinity pH Nitrate Nitrite Phosphate

The main method when run will read in the data, calculate one-var and two-var statistics, and create a chart, all comparing salinity levels of various locations around UA to the conductivity. The data is then compared to relative levels of freshwater.
